          savor the nostalgia and taste of a secret 1920s doughnut recipe in a gorgeous vintage environment.
          <br /><br />
          In early 2002, we set out to create that space. What started as a daydream between
          brothers led to a single storefront on Capitol Hill. Thanks to the incredible support of the communities weâ€™ve
          had the pleasure of serving, Top Pot has grown throughout the Puget Sound.
          <br /><br />
          We remain committed to the simple ideals that brought us this far-quality, inclusiveness,
          and integrity in every single thing we do.
